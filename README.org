* Obsidian
  
  An embedded language for GPU kernel programming. 

* News:  
  + Obsidian does not depend on the "CUDA" package anymore. 
    If running on a GPU from haskell (by using the CUDA package) 
    is desired, the Obsidian-Run-CUDA package should be installed as well

* TODO: 
  + "Up" the versions 
  + Remove all example code that relies on CUDA (Move to another repo)  
  

* Versioning Policy (from Apr 14 2014 with the release of version 0.1.0.0) 
  + A.B.C.D  
  + A.B changes when API Changes (in a disruptive way) 
  + C   changes with additions that does not break existing programs 
  + D   Bugfixes and internal hacking.

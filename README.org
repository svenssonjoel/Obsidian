* BRANCH PRE BIG CHANGES IN NOV2014

* Obsidian
  
  An embedded language for GPU kernel programming. 
  
* Current features 
    + Pull arrays: traditional "arrays as function from index to value" 
    + Push arrays: a computation that is parameterised on a "write
      function". 
    + Executing kernels from within Haskell is possible on platforms 
      supported by the CUDA bindings (Linux, Mac). 
      Obsidian.Run.CUDA.Exec provides a very low level interface to
      running kernels. 

* In Progress
    + Support for CUDA Vector types (float4, Double2). 
    + Mutable arrays:
      Mutable arrays in shared memory can be created.
      Global mutable arrays can be passed into a kernel as an argument. 
    + Atomic operations on mutable arrays.

  
* TODOs
  + Interface with cub in some way. 
    Allow the programmer to call functions from the cub library 
     - Blockwide operations. 
    
  + Look at code generation, is there a problem with the memory management ? 
	    

* Versioning Policy (from Apr 14 2014 with the release of version 0.1.0.0) 
  + A.B.C.D  
  + A.B changes when API Changes (in a disruptive way) 
  + C   changes with additions that does not break existing programs 
  + D   Bugfixes and internal hacking.

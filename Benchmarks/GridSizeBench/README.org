* Experiment with varying number of blocks while keeping the amount of work fixed. 

  + Base on reductions 
  + fix number of threads (for example 512) 
  + Vary number of blocks (1 to thousands) 
  + fix input data size (16M elements for example)


  + Same experiment with scan, pretend we have carry stringing capability.
